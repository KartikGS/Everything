# Architecture Decision Records — Everything

We use ADRs to document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Everything platform.

## Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNNN]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
[What is the situation that requires a decision?]

## Decision
[What was decided?]

## Consequences
[What are the trade-offs and implications of this decision?]
```

## Naming

`ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md` — e.g., `ADR-0001-workspace-root-convention.md`

## Lifecycle

- `Proposed` → under discussion, not yet binding
- `Accepted` → binding; all agents must follow
- `Deprecated` → no longer applies; do not remove for historical record
- `Superseded by ADR-XXXX` → replaced by a newer decision; link to the new one

## Index

*(No ADRs yet — add entries here as decisions are made.)*
