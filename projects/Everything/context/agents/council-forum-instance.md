# Council Forum — Everything Instance

> This is the project-specific instantiation of the general council forum protocol for the **Everything** project.
>
> General protocol: `projects/Everything/general/agents/workflows/council-forum.md`
>
> Council config: `projects/Everything/council-config.json` (generated by `scripts/init.js` — may not exist if no council was configured)

## Status

The Everything project's council is configured at runtime via `scripts/init.js`. This file provides the structural template and fallback guidance.

**If `council-config.json` exists**: Load it to determine the actual member names, perspectives, and sequencing for this session.

**If `council-config.json` does not exist**: Everything has no council. Platform decisions are made directly by the human. Skip this file.

---

## Default Forum Sequence (when council is configured)

Load `council-config.json` and invoke members in this order:

1. All `normal_pos` members — in array order (po-1, po-2, ...)
2. All `devils_advocates` members — in array order (da-1, da-2, ...)

Each member's prompt context includes:
- Their `name` and `perspective` from the config
- Their role definition (Normal PO or DA — from `general/agents/roles/`)
- The user's message
- All prior council members' responses in this round

---

## Platform-Level Discussion Scope

The Everything council deliberates on **platform-level decisions**, including:
- Changes to the general agent role definitions
- New workflow patterns to add to `general/agents/workflows/`
- Changes to the council forum protocol itself
- Scope and direction of the Everything platform
- Prioritisation of projects within the Everything workspace

The council does **not** deliberate on:
- Implementation details (file paths, code structure — that is the Tech Lead's domain)
- Project-specific decisions for sub-projects like LJourney (each project governs itself)
- Style preferences with no meaningful impact on project direction

---

## Handoff

When the human approves a council decision:
- The majority position is handed to the BA as **project intent**
- All council members step back — they do not influence the BA or Tech Lead
- Unresolved DA challenges are documented alongside the majority position in `agent-work/`

## Artefact Location

Council discussion artefacts for Everything are stored in:
`projects/Everything/agent-work/`

Naming convention: `COUNCIL-YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md`
