# Council Forum Protocol

> This document is project-agnostic. It defines the sequential forum protocol for a configured council of Project Owners. For project-specific council member names, perspectives, and instantiation details, see the project's `context/agents/council-forum-instance.md`.

---

## Purpose

The council forum is a structured, sequential deliberation mechanism. When the user sends a message, each council member responds in turn — building on what came before — before the orchestrator presents a consolidated summary and awaits the human's next input.

This protocol enforces the deliberation phases defined in `normal-project-owner.md` and `devils-advocate-project-owner.md` without requiring a separate UI or external service.

---

## Prerequisites

Before invoking the forum:
1. A `council-config.json` must exist in the project directory, generated by `scripts/init.js`.
2. The project's `context/agents/council-forum-instance.md` must be loaded to identify member names, perspectives, and sequencing.
3. The general role definitions must be accessible:
   - `general/agents/roles/normal-project-owner.md`
   - `general/agents/roles/devils-advocate-project-owner.md`

---

## Sequential Invocation Order

Members are always invoked in this order within a single forum round:

1. **Normal PO 1** → first to respond; sets the initial constructive position
2. **Normal PO 2** → reads user message + PO-1 response; builds or diverges
3. **Normal PO 3** *(if configured)* → reads all prior PO responses
4. **Normal PO 4** *(if configured)* → reads all prior PO responses
5. **Devil's Advocate 1** → reads all Normal PO responses; raises a structured challenge
6. **Devil's Advocate 2** *(if configured)* → reads all prior responses including DA-1

Each member receives:
- The user's message (verbatim)
- All prior council members' responses in this round (accumulated)
- Their role definition
- Their personal name and perspective from the council config

---

## Member Response Contracts

### Normal Project Owner Response

Each Normal PO response must:
- Directly address the user's message
- State a clear position or recommendation
- Engage with any prior PO perspectives (agree, refine, or respectfully diverge)
- Not dismiss challenges without engaging — DA challenges come later, but a PO who anticipates them should address them proactively

A Normal PO response that does not take a position is a protocol violation.

### Devil's Advocate Response

Each DA response must follow the mandatory challenge format from `devils-advocate-project-owner.md`:

```
**Risk**: [Specific failure mode or unconsidered consequence if the current direction is adopted]

**Alternative**: [At least one viable alternative direction that avoids or mitigates the risk]

**Question for the group** *(optional)*: [A specific question the group must answer before the risk can be classified as mitigated]
```

A DA response that omits the **Alternative** is invalid and must be flagged before the round closes.

---

## Round Lifecycle

### Step 1 — User Message
The human sends a message (a question, a proposal, a direction to deliberate on, or a request for a decision).

### Step 2 — Normal PO Responses (sequential)
Each Normal PO is invoked in order. Each sees the user's message and all prior Normal PO responses.

### Step 3 — Devil's Advocate Responses (sequential)
Each DA is invoked in order. Each sees the user's message and all prior responses (both PO and DA).

### Step 4 — Orchestrator Summary
After all members have responded, the orchestrator presents:
1. A summary of the consensus/majority position emerging from the Normal POs
2. Each DA challenge (Risk + Alternative), clearly labelled
3. A status: **Discussion open** or **Ready for human approval**

### Step 5 — Human Response
The human either:
- Continues the discussion (sends another message → new round begins from Step 1)
- Approves the majority position → triggers BA handoff (see below)
- Redirects the discussion (modifies the proposal → new round begins)
- Makes a unilateral decision

---

## Human Approval Gate

**No BA handoff occurs without explicit human approval.**

When the human approves, the orchestrator:
1. Documents the approved majority position
2. Documents any unresolved DA challenges (minority positions)
3. Hands off to the BA as **project intent** — what the project should achieve and why
4. All council members step back — they do not follow up into BA or Tech Lead execution

---

## Escalation Rules

If a DA challenge cannot be resolved within the group after two rounds:
- The DA must use `escalated to human` designation
- The orchestrator surfaces it to the human alongside the majority position
- The human decides whether to block, override, or redirect

Looping on the same challenge indefinitely is a protocol violation.

---

## Orchestrator Responsibilities

The orchestrator (the Claude instance running the forum) is responsible for:
- Loading the council config and role definitions before each round
- Invoking each member in the correct sequence
- Accumulating responses so each member has full context
- Detecting protocol violations (missing DA alternatives, PO silence, DA looping)
- Presenting the round summary in a consistent format
- Enforcing the human approval gate before any BA handoff

The orchestrator does NOT take positions or cast votes.

## Example Round Summary Format

```
─── Council Forum — Round [N] ───────────────────────────────────────

User message: "[verbatim]"

Normal PO Responses:
  Alex (user-focused):     [summary of position]
  Jordan (business-focused): [summary of position]

Devil's Advocate Challenges:
  Morgan (risk-focused):
    Risk:        [...]
    Alternative: [...]

Emerging majority position:
  [One-paragraph synthesis of the direction the Normal POs converged on]

Status: Discussion open — awaiting your response or approval.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Protocol Checklist (Per Round)

- [ ] All Normal POs have responded with a clear position
- [ ] All DAs have responded with a valid Risk + Alternative
- [ ] No DA challenge is missing its Alternative field
- [ ] The orchestrator summary clearly states the emerging majority position
- [ ] Unresolved DA challenges are surfaced — not buried
- [ ] No BA handoff has occurred without explicit human approval
